//! What is Javascript
//+ JavaScript is a dynamic, weakly typed programming language which is compiled at runtime. It can be executed as part of a
//+ webpage in a browser or directly on any machine (‚Äúhost environment‚Äù).
//+ JavaScript was created to make webpages more dynamic (e.g. change content on a page directly from inside the browser).
//+ Originally, it was called LiveScript but due to the popularity of Java, it was renamed to JavaScript.
//+ JavaScript is totally independent from Java and has nothing in common with Java. JavaScript is case sensitive
// !Dynamic? Weakly Typed
//+ Dynamic, interpreted Programming Language.
//+ Not pre-compiled, instead parsed and compiled ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù (e.g. in the browser)
//+ Code evaluated and executed at runtime. Code can change at runtime (e.g. type of a variable)
//+ Weakly Typed Programming Language
//+ Data types are assumed (e.g. assigned to variables) automatically. You don‚Äôt define that some variable has to hold a certain
//+ value (e.g. a number) . Data types are not set in stone but can change

//! JavaScript Runs On A Host Environment
//+ Browser-side
//+ JavaScript was invented to create more  dynamic websites by executing in the  browser! JavaScript can manipulate the HTML code,
//+ CSS, send background Http requests & much more
//+ JavaScript CAN‚ÄôT access the local filesystem, interact with the operating system etc
//+ ‚ÄúOther‚Äù (e.g. Server-side)
//+ Google‚Äôs JavaScript Engine (V8) was  extracted to run JavaScript anywhere  (called ‚ÄúNode.js‚Äù) Node.js can be executed on any
//+ machine and is therefore often used to build web backend (server-side JavaScript) . Node.js CAN access the local filesystem,
//+ interact with the operating system etc. It CAN‚ÄôT manipulate HTML or CSS

//* To import the js file
//* <script src="./assets/scripts/app.js"></script>
//+if we put  this at the end of the html. then the js execute at the end. if we put at the beginning js will execute before html rendering
//% It is not working for me üò¢

//! Variables and constants
//+ we can use let keyword to initialize a variable. and we can change the value along the way
let variableName = "value";
//+ we can use constant as well. the value is not changeable and throws error
const constantName = "value";

//+ there are operators like + - * / % and ** for exponential. also =

//+ we can use '' or "" for assigning string. but we ca use ``  this as well
let out = `(${variableName} + 10) * 3`; //+ we can use this to get the value between the string. this is called template literals
out = `one + one = ${1 + 1}`; //+ we can do any normal code here
//+ we can use \n for next line. for backslash we need double \\

//! functions
function name(parameter) {
  parameter = parameter; //+ we can do some operation
}

//+ javascript always read the data from the input as strings
//+ we can use parseInt and parseFloat for converting from string. we can use +stringValue as well
parseInt("3");
out = 1 + +"10"; //+ we can do something like this as well

//+ to convert a number to string we can use .toString()
out = out.toString();

out++; //+ returns the value before it changes
++out; //+ returns the value after it changes

let array = [];
array.push(1); //+ we can add value to array like this
let anObject = { name: "abc" };
//+ we can push object to array as well

//+ undefined is a default value of uninitialized variable
//+ null is not a default value, we have to set something to it
//+ NaN is not a number. when we do a mathematical operation with a value which is not a number. we will get NAN 3*'hi

typeof "name"; //+ to find the type of the variable. this returns "string"

//! Importing of a file
//+ while importing javascript file. its good to add defer keyword . it will make the js file downloaded early and executed after rendering of html
//* <script type="text/javascript" src="./assets/scripts/app.js" defer></script>

//+ we can use async as well, if we want to download the js and execute the same time as the html render. good when js is not related to the html.
//+ order of execution of script is not guaranteed here. if there are two script importing.. then both can execute same time

//+ ctrl + shift + space for help parameter menu
//+ we can use source window for finding the code and putting debugger. also we can put conditional breakpoint as well.
//+ we can change the values of file directly to the local file from browser without reloading. also we can select event listeners to trigger debugging

//+  === operator is used to check the value as well as the type

//+ we cannot check equality of 2 objects which are looks same. it gives false
let v1 = { name: "Max" };
let v2 = { name: "Max" };

v1 == v2; //+ it will be false but
let v3 = v1;
v3 === v1; //+ this will be true

//! Operator precedence
//https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence

//! truly and falsy values
//+ In some cases, even if we don't provide any condition boolean check, still js can return true or false, if the variable is a truthy value
let nameCheck = "Max";
if (nameCheck) {
  //+ this can return true
}

//+ 0 will return false
nameCheck = 0;
if (nameCheck) {
} //+ this will be false. other numbers including -ve values will be true

//+ '' will be false. any other string will be true. {} [] and other objects will be true. null undefined and NaN will be false

//+ we can use event listeners to a element using addEventListener
attackBtn.addEventListener("click", attachHandler);
//+ here attachHandler is a function that we need to call

//+ we can use prompt function to see a popup where we can type some value

//+ we can use isNaN function for checking the value is NaN or not
isNaN(nameCheck);

//+Ternary Operator
nameCheck = isLogin ? "Login" : null;

//% !! can be used to convert the truthy or falsy value to real true or false
!!""; //+ this will give false than falsy value
!!1; //+ This will give true than truthy value

//% Default value assignment via OR operator
nameCheck = someInput || "Max"; //+ if someInput is empty, Max will be assign to the const

//% use value if condition is true via AND operator
nameCheck = isLoggedIn && "Max"; //+ Max is returned if isLogged is true. false otherwise. here isLogged in is a real true or false value

//! switch Case statement
switch (ev) {
  case "value1": //+ condition
    "value1 + 1"; //+ code need to be executed
    break;
  case "value2":
    "value 2 +1";
    break;
  default:
    "value 3 +1";
}

//! Loops
//% for loop
//+ Execute code a certain amount of times (with counter variable)
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

//% for 0f loop
//+Execute for every element in an array
for (const el of array) {
  console.log(el);
}

//+ if we need to know the index, we can use extra code. but the loop does not provide the index details
let i = 0;
for (const el of array) {
  console.log(i);
  console.log(el);
  i++;
}

//% for in loop
//+ Execute for every key in an object
for (const key in obj) {
  console.log(key);
  console.log(obj[key]);
}

//% while loop
//+ Execute code as long as a condition is true
while (isLoggedIn) {}

//%
do {} while (isLoggedIn);

//% we can use break keyword to break the loop
//% we can use continue to continue to next loop

//% labeled statements
//+ if we want to break the outer loop from the inner loop we can name the loops and break using the name

outerWhile: while (isLoggedIn) {
  innerFor: for (const el of array) {
    console.log(i);
    console.log(el);
    i++;
    break outerWhile;
  }
}

//! error handling
//% we can use throw keyword to throw error
throw { message: "An error occurred" };
//+ if we throw the error then the application crashes and none of the other code execute  than finally
//% try catch
try {
  for (const key in obj) {
    console.log(key);
    console.log(obj[key]);
  }
} catch (error) {
  alert(error);
  console.log(error);
} finally {
}

//% ES5
//+ Supported in basically all browser, including old IE
//+ Only had var, not let or const
//+ Generally same syntax as ES6, but quite some missing feature

//% ES6
//+ Supported in modern browsers, can (mostly) be transpiler to ES5
//+ Many new features that help us write cleaner, better & faster code
//+ Still under active development, but ES6 was a big step forward

//% var and let
//+ if we initialize a global variable as name. and if we initialize same variable again inside the function, it will not throw error.
//+ it will shadow the global variable. but if we re create same variable using let in global scope. it throws error.
//+ but for var, we can re create the variable in global scope as well.

//+ let and const are available in block level. inside{}. and will not be available outside
//+ we can use both let var and const in global scope

//+ if we initialize the variable using var at the end of code and try to use it before initialization, it will not throw error and return
//+ undefined as value but let and const will throw error.
//+ let and const is block level, available inside the if statement only
console.log(userName); //+ here output will be undefined. but for let, it will be an error. because for var, the variable is initialized with undefined.

var userName = "Ans";

//+ if we don't mention var while initializing a variable. it will still work
userAge = 100; //+ this will work, and js automatically add var.
//+ we can turn this off bu turning on strict mode
("use strict"); //+ this will turn on strict mode

//! Primitive vs Reference Values
//% Primitive Values
//+ Strings, Numbers, Booleans, null, undefined, Symbol
//+ Stored in memory (normally on Stack), variable stores value itself
//+ Copying a variable (= assign to different variable) copies the value

//% Reference Values
//+ All other objects (‚Äúmore expensive to create‚Äù)
//+ Stored in memory (Heap), variable stores a pointer (address) to location in memory
//+ Copying a variable (= assign to different variable) copies the pointer/ reference

//% to copy object to new object, we can use
let person = { age: 30 };
let newPerson = { ...person }; //+ this will create a new object with different reference
let hobbies = ["cricket"];
let moreHobbies = [...hobbies];

//!garbage collector

//! Functions

//+ if we attach a function to an object, then its called a method
//+ functions are objects
//+ we can attach a function inside a variable
let start = function startGame() {
  alert("Starting game");
};
//+ but in this case, we need to call it after initialized. if we try to call the function before initialized it will return undefined.
//+ but normal function can be called from anywhere without initializing.it automatically calls the function

//% Anonymous functions
attackBtn.addEventListener("click", function () {
  alert("Starting game");
});
//+ we can add a anonymous function like this.
attackBtn.addEventListener("click", function startGame() {
  //+ we can give name to the anonymous function as well
  alert("Starting game");
});

let start = (value) => {
  alert("Starting game");
};
//+ we can declare a anonymous function like this

let start = (value) => value + 1;
//+ we can us this as well and directly return
//+ if there is no statements in the body, we should use {}
//+ if there is one parameter, we can omit the ()
//+ one statement, then we can eliminate {}
//% we can use .toUpperCase() in a string to convert it to uppercase.

let start = function startGame(value, value2 = 10) {
  alert("Starting game");
};
start(1); //+ here second value by default it will be 10.  even if we pass undefined, still it will take the default value

let start = function startGame(...value) {
  //+here everything we pass will be consider as a array
  let sum = 0;
  for (const el of value) {
    sum += el;
  }
  return sum;
};

start(1, 54, 7, 2, 77, 2); //+ Input values will be converted to an array
//+ always better to declare this parameter at the end
//+ we can use arguments keyword to get the input as array as well.
let start = function startGame(v, ...arguments) {
  //+here everything we pass will be consider as a array
  let sum = 0;
  for (const el of arguments) {
    //+ we will get inputs as array
    sum += el;
  }
  return sum;
};

start(1, 54, 7, 2, 77, 2);

//% callback functions
//+ we can pass a function as variable and we can utilise that function
let start = function startGame(resultHandler, ...values) {
  //+here everything we pass will be consider as a array
  let sum = 0;
  for (const el of values) {
    //+ we will get inputs as array

  resultHandler(sum);
};
const alertResult = (sum) => alert("the result is" + sum);

start(alertResult, 1, 56, 83, 6, 98, 4, 2); //+ we can pass the function as the variable
//+ here we are passing a pointer to the function and we are finally calling the function. this is how event handler works
//+ if we want to pass some values to  the callback function early itself, we can pass it using .bind() method. first argument is this,
//+ then we can pass other inputs. whenever we pass more parameters to the callback function
let start = function startGame(resultHandler, ...values) {
  //+here everything we pass will be consider as a array
  let sum = 0;
  for (const el of values) {
    //+ we will get inputs as array

};
const alertResult = (message, sum) => alert(message + sum);
start(alertResult.bind(this, "output is : "), 1, 56, 83, 6, 98, 4, 2); //+ here the 'output is : ' will send as first argument to the callback function.

//+ .apply() and .call() methods will immediately call the function. start.call()

//! The Document Object Model (DOM)
//+Exposes Web API to allow JavaScript to work with the parsed document

//! Document and window
//% document
//+ root dom node. provide access to element querying . dom content etc. document is part of window
//% window
//+ the active browser window/ tab. acts as global storage for script , also provide access to window specific properties and methods

//% there are element node as well as text node in DOM
//+ element node is the representation of the element. and text node is representation of text.

//% querySelector(), getElementById() returns single element. different ways of querying elements(by css selector, by id).
//% Direct reference to DOM is returned querySelectorAll(), getElementByTagName() Return collection of elements(array like object)
//% node list. different ways of querying elements by css selector , by tag name , by css class). quey selectorAll() returns a
//% non-live Node list, getXbyY returns live node list

//! finding the elements
document.getElementById("main-title");
document.getElementsByClassName("items"); //+ this is old way of using it
document.querySelector(".items"); //+ this will return only the first item. we can select class or id or elements
document.querySelectorAll(".items"); //+ this will return multiple items
document.querySelector("ul li:first-of-type");

const ul = document.getElementById("list");
ul.querySelector(".items"); //+ we acn so this as well. but we cannot use getElementById

//!text content
const h1 = document.getElementById("main-title");
h1.textContent; //+ this will return the text content
h1.className; //+  will give the class name.

//! style
//+ we can access the styling
h1.style.background = "red";

const input = document.querySelector("input");
input.value = "new input"; //+ this will reflect to the UI. but not in the html element
input.setAttribute("value", "some other default text"); //+ we can set attribute like this

input.getAttribute("value"); //+ we can use this to get the attribute

//!Children
const ul = document.querySelector("ul");
ul.children; //+ for finding the children.     ul.children [0]

ul.childNodes; //+ this will provide both text as well as element node

ul.firstElementChild; //+ this can be used to find the first element child

//!Parent
ul.children[0].parentElement; //+  ul.children[0].parentNode    both will be same
ul.children[0].closest("body"); //+ closest will give parent

//! Sibling
ul.previousElementSibling; //+ can be used to find the sibling
ul.nextElementSibling;

//! Styling
ul.style.background = "green";
ul.className = "bg-green"; //+ this will completely replace the classes

ul.classList.toggle("visible"); //+ this will add or remove depends on the availability of class

//! adding elements
//+ we can add inner html. replace it or we can append.. but in this case the inner html is re render,
//+ which deletes the user entered info

//+ we can use like this as well
input.insertAdjacentHTML("afterend", "<p>some content</p>");
//+ <!-- beforebegin -->
//+ <p>
//+   <!-- afterbegin -->
//+   foo
//+   <!-- beforeend -->
//+ </p>
//+ <!-- afterend -->

const newLi = document.createElement("li"); //+ we can create an element like this. but do it only on document
const list = document.querySelector("ul");
newLi.textContent = "item 4";
list.appendChild(newLi); //+append the element to the other element

list.append("new value"); //+ we can use append as well. IE doesn't support
movieListElement.append(movieListItem);
list.prepend(newLi); //+ this will add at the beginning

list.lastElementChild.before(newLi); //+ we can add before the last element. after work as well

replaceWith(); //+ used for replacing
list.insertAdjacentElement("afterend", newLi); //+ we can use like this as well

//+ cloning element
newLi.cloneNode(true); //+ it will clone the element. if we pass true, everything inside will be cloned.
//+ if false, only that element is cloned

//+ querySelectorAll() is having live value
//+ .getElementByClassName() or other similar will not be live

//! Remove
const list = document.querySelector("ul");
list.remove(); //+ this will remove the content
list.parentElement.removeChild(list); //+ this will work as well

//+ for selecting an element we can use multiple ways
document.querySelector("body button");
document.getElementById("buttonID");
document.body.children[3];
document.querySelector("header").lastElementChild;

//+ getElementById can be faster. last two of them can have some risks

title.trim(); //+ can be used to trim the text
movies.splice(index); //+ can be used to remove the array on specific index
movieListElement.children[index].remove(); //+ deleting the item using index

//+ if we initialize a button event inside another button event. it can lead to multiple existing event on a single button an
//+ leads to problem. there are technique to solve it. for now we can use these approaches
cancelDeleteButton.removeEventListener("click", closeTheModal); //+ we can simply remove the event listener

//+ if the event listener function have a bind. then it will  not be possible to delete. so we can do a hack
let confirmDeletePopupButton = deleteModalElement.querySelector(".btn--danger");
confirmDeletePopupButton.replaceWith(confirmDeletePopupButton.cloneNode(true));
//+ we can replace the button with another. so this will remove all the even listeners
confirmDeletePopupButton = deleteModalElement.querySelector(".btn--danger");

//! Arrays
//% Iterable
//+ object where we can use for-of-loop.
//% Array-like
//+ Object that have a length property and indexes to access them.

//% but they ar not real array
//! Creating an array
const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
const myArray2 = new Array(); //+ this is equals to []  . we can remove new keyword, it will work
const myArray3 = new Array("hello", "world"); //+ this is equals to ["hello", "world"]

const myArray4 = new Array(5); //+ this will create an empty array of size 5
const array5 = Array.of(1, 2); //+ this will work as well.

const array6 = Array.from(someIterable); //+ this is used to convert an iterable or array like object to array
const array6 = Array.from("Hi!"); //+ this will create ['H', 'i', '!']

const listItems = document.querySelectorAll("li");
//+ this will create a node list. which is not an actual array. but array like object. all array methods will not be there
const array6 = Array.from(listItems); //+ this will convert to real array

const myArray5 = [1, "23"]; //+ we can have different type
const array6 = [
  [1, 2],
  [6, 7],
]; //+ we can have multi dimensional array

myArray[0]; //+ can use index. 0 indexed

//! push and pop
myArray.push(5);
//+ this can be used to push new items at the end of the array. this will return the length as well, if we need it
myArray.unshift(10); //+ this will add at the beginning of the array. this will return the length as well, if we need it
const removedItem = myArray.pop(); //+ last element is removed at the end and returned
myArray.shift(); //+ it removes first item from the array and returned
//+ shift and unshift are slower than push and pop

myArray[2] = 6; //+ this will replace the item
myArray[10] = 10; //+ if we try to add it to some none existing index, it add empty items in between and add the item to that index.

//! splice
myArray.splice(1, 1); //+ this will delete the second item. it will go to 1 index and delete next 1 item. we can delete multiple items
myArray.splice(0, 2); //+ this will delete 1st 2 elements

myArray.splice(0, 0, "hello", "how are you"); //+ this will go to first element and delete next 0 elements and then insert the
//+ elements mentioned. as we mention 0 as delete, it will not delete anything, instead insert next items
myArray.splice(1, 2, "hello", "how are you"); //+ this will go to 1 index and delete next 2 items and then insert in the middle.
//+ if we don't want to delete, we can give the delete index as 0

myArray.splice(2); //+ this will delete everything past to index 2
myArray.splice(0); //+ this will delete everything in the array

//% splice will return the removed items

myArray.splice(-1, 1); //+ due to -1. this will go to the end and do the operation. here last element  is deleted.
//+ -2 will go to second last element

//! slice
const newArray = myArray.slice(); //+ this can be used to return a new array
const slicedArray = myArray.slice(1, 2);
//+ this will go to 1st index and select 2 elements and return a new array. we can use -ve values as well
const resatArray = myArray.slice(2); //+ this will get everything after 2nd index.

//! concat
newArray = myArray.concat([5, 6, 7]);
//+ this will add one array to another array. push will not work this way, push accepts multiple items

const index = myArray.indexOf(3);
//+ this will find the index of that specific value. if there are multiple same values, it only returns the first index.
index = myArray.indexOf(3, 2); //+ this will search after 2nd index.

index = myArray.lastIndexOf(2);
//+ but finding index of a object will not work and returns -1. if it didn't find anything.it returns -1

//! find
//+ we can use find to find the object in an array.
const personalData = [{ name: "Max" }, { name: "Manual" }];
manual = personalData.find((person, index, persons) => {
  //+ first parameter is item from the array. second parameter is index. third parameter entire array.
  return person.name === "Manual"; //+ this will return that specific object which became true;
});

personalData.findIndex(manual); //+ this can return the index of the object

myArray.includes(5); //+ this will returns true or false if the value exists.

//! foreach

const { formattedName } = anotherPersonData;
formattedName(); //+ this will not work. here this is not anotherPersonData. because anotherPersonData is not responsible

//+ to fix this. we can use bind and pass this parameter. bind first parameter is this
let { formattedName } = anotherPersonData;
formattedName = formattedName.bind(anotherPersonData); //+ now this will be referring to anotherPersonData.and it will work

//+ we can use call() function as well. so we can directly call by passing the object

//! OOP

//! Classes
//+ classes are blue prints of objects. Define how an object looks like and what properties and methods it have

class Product {
  name = "DefaulT name"; //+ we can give a default value`
  price;
  url;

  constructor(name, price, url) {
    //+ we can use constructor to initialize the object
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
    this.url = url;
  }
  someMethod() {} //+ we can create functions like this
}

//+ creating an object
new Product();
const prod = new Product("pillow", 100, "url");

class Product {
  constructor(name, price, url) {
    //+ we ca do like this as well. without the fields, we can initialize  the properties. not need to mention the fields
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
    this.url = url;
    this.totalOutput = cartEl.querySelector("h2");
  }
}

//! static fields and methods
//+ define with static keyword. can be accessible by class itself
class App {
  static init() {
    const shop = new Shop();
    shop.render();
    this.cart = shop.cart;
  }

  static addProductToCart(product) {
    this.cart.addProduct(product);
  }
}

cartSum.toFixed(2); //+ can be used to floating number

//! Inheritance
class Product extends App {
  //+ we can add inheritance like this. only one inheritance supported

  constructor(derivedV) {
    super(derivedV); //+ we can call base class constructor by super(v) method
  }
}
class App {
  constructor(value) {
    this.v = value;
  }
}

new Product("something");

//! revisit the concept


//! different way of calling function
class cart{
  oderProducts(){
    console.log(this.items);
  }

  render(){
    orderButton.addEventListener('click', this.oderProducts);
    //+ if we do like that, we will not get a proper this as we expected in the calling function, instead we get button event

    orderButton.addEventListener('click', () => this.oderProducts());
    //+ but if we do like this, the targeting function will get proper this. because arrow functions will get outer this as inner this
    //+ but as you can see, we should call the handler function in the arrow function. we can use .bind as well. this is another approach
  }
}

//! private methods or properties
//+ will only available inside the class or object
class someName{
  #privateVariable = [];   //+ initializing a private variable . to access it also we need to use #
}

//! Instance of
//+ we can find if the object is created based on a class
p instanceof person    //+ this will return true if p is a instance of person

//! object creation
const obj1 = new Object(); //+ slower

//! Object Descriptors
//+ inside every items of an object, some hidden properties are available. we can modify them
Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(person)  //+ getOwnPropertyDescriptor will work too. This will give the details of it
//+ it contains below properties
//+ configurable: true
//+ enumerable: true
//+ value: "ans"
//+ writable: true

//+ we can add our own values to the object and configure these properties
Object.defineProperties(person, 'name', {
  configurable: true,  //+ we can give different values. if we set to false, we cannot delete the property
  enumerable: true,   //+ if we set to false, we cannot iterate
  value: "ans",
  writable: true   //+ if we set to false, we cannot modify
})

//! Prototypes
//+ prototypes are used before classes.

//!Constructor function.
//+ ways used before classes. its a blueprint of objects. can hold properties and classes . Classes uses constructor functions in the background
function person(){
  this.age = 20;
  this.name = 'Max';
  this.greet = function(){
    console.log('Hi I am' + this.name);
  };
};

const person = new Person();   //+ we can call person.greet() because we have a new keyword. if its not there we cant call it.
person.greet();

//+ what happens internally when we use new keyword is
function person(){
  this = {}   //+ it creates a this and bind everything and returns it.
  this.age = 20;
  this.name = 'Max';
  this.greet = function(){
    console.log('Hi I am' + this.name);
  };

  return this;
};

//! Prototype
//+ inheritance in the classes is done by prototype in the background
//+ prototype is an object inside the other object. every object have a prototype. prototype object is like a fallback object.
//+ javascript will searches inside prototype for functions or properties if they cant find it outside.

//+ for example person.toString(). js will try to find it in the person object and then it will search inside the prototype.
//+ Till it reach the end of the prototype.
//+ person.__proto__ is a prototype inside person. Inside of that you can find another prototype. Which will be available for all the objects
//+ __proto__ will be available in all the objects
//+ prototype property will be only available in function properties or objects. it will be like a constructor. whatever we menton
//+ inside the prototype will be assigned to __proto__ and will be available for all the objects which made of
//+ we can add modify function as below.
person.prototype= {
  printAge(){
    console.log(this.age);
  }
}

person.prototype.printAge= function(){   //+ this is the better approach than above. above we replace the entire object
    console.log(this.age);
}

person.printAge();   //+ this will now execute

//% class and extends use prototype
class Person extends UserAge{
  age = 20;
  name = 'Max';
  greet = function(){
    console.log('Hi I am' + this.name);
  };
  constructor(){
    super();
  }
}

class UserAge{
  myAge = function(){
    console.log('Hi I am' + this.age);
  };
}

let p = new Person()
//+ if we do p.__proto__ , we can see UserAge and inside we can see the myAge function.
//+ Methods in classes will be available as a new prototype for optimization
//+ assigning function to a property or variable can cause performance issues. very small

//+ for an existing object, if we want to modify or see prototype, we can use some methods.
Object.getPrototypeOf(p);

//+ we can set using below function
Object.setPrototypeOf(person, {
  ...Object.getPrototypeOf(p),
  printRating: function () {
    console.log(5);
  }
})

const student = Object.create({printRating: function () {     //+ we can create empty object with prototype
  console.log(5);
}});

const student = Object.create({printRating: function () {     //+ we can do like this as well
  console.log(5);
}}, {name: {
  configurable: true,
  enumerable: true,
  value: "ans",
  writable: true
}});
student.name ="max"

//! revisit the project

//! Attaching data to an element
//* <div class="className" data-some-data-value="value of data"></div>
//+ we can add data top the element like this

//+ we can see all the data using
console.log(element.dataset)
const some = element.dataset.someDataValue;    //+ here the data attribute name automatically convert to pascal casing
element.dataset.someInfo = 'Bla Bla';    //+ this will be added to the element

//! Finding the box dimensions
element.getBoundingClientRect();   //+ this will give the dimension of the element in the screen, x, y, height properties available
//+ x and y will be considered from left top corner. and x will increase to the right. y will increase to the bottom
$0.getBoundingClientRect() //+ can be used as a shortcut for selecting some element
$0.offsetTop //+ this will give the top length;
$0.offsetLeft //+ this will give left distance

$0.clientTop  //+ this can be used to find the top distance from left top of the element to the inner content
$0.clintLeft  //+ this can be used to find the left distance from left top of the element to the inner content

$0.offsetHeight //+ can be used to find the height of the element
$0.offsetWidth  //+ can be used to find the width of the element

$0.clientWidth  //+ this can give the width of inner item in the element
$0.clientHeight

$0.scrollHeight //+ can be used to view the entire scrollable height. which includes what we not showing on the UI
$0.scrollTop  //+ this will give the distance of scroll from the top. (how much we scrolled)
//+ we can see element more on msdn

window.innerWidth  //+ for entire window width
window.innerHeight

document.documentElement.clientWidth  //+ used to find the total body width. excluding scrollbar. above method consider scrollbar
document.documentElement.clientHeight

//+ for setting the values, we cannot use this. we need to use style

$0.scrollHeight

element.scrollIntoView();   //+ this will scroll to the element
element.scrollIntoView({behavior: 'smooth'});

element.scrollTo(0, 100);   //+ can be used to scroll to specific pixel
element.scrollBy(0, 100)
element.scrollBy({top:50, behavior: 'smooth'})


//! template
//+ for creating an html element, we were using inner html.
const cartEl = document.createElement("section");
cartEl.innerHTML = `
  <h2>Total: \$${0}</h2>
  <button>Order Now!</button>
`;

//+ instead we can use template tag in html. we can create a template element in HTML, which will not render in the UI. so we can get it and we can
//+ use it in the js. so we don't manually need to write it on js.

<template id="someID">
  <h2>Total</h2>
  <button>Order Now!</button>
</template>

const templateElement = document.getElementById("someID");
const templateBody = document.importNode(templateElement.content, true);   //+ true for deep clone
templateBody.querySelector('h2').textContent = "Total: $100";
mainElement.append(templateBody);

//+ this will make the html independent and easy from the js

//! Adding script inside js
const someScript = document.createElement('script');
someScript.textContent = "alert('Hello');";
document.head.append(someScript);
//+ it can be useful if we want to download one script at perticular point of time only

function startAnalytics(){
  const analyticsScript = document.createElement('script');
  analyticsScript.src = 'assets/script/analytics.js';
  analyticsScript.defer = true;
  document.head.append(analyticsScript);
}

//+ this function can be called whenever user needs and we can download the file and append to it.

//! Timer
const timerId = setTimeout(startAnalytics, 3000, [])  //+ first parameter is the function that we need to execute, and second parameter is interval in milliseconds
//+ third parameter can be an array of parameters to the function that we are calling.
clearTimeout(timerId);   //+ this will stop the timer



const intervalID =  setInterval(startAnalytics, 3000, [])  //+ this will make the call in every 3 second interval
clearInterval(intervalID);

//! location
//+ we can use location object to know about the website location and and navigate
location.href = 'someLocation' //+ this can navigate to different url
location.assign('someLocation')  //+ same as href
location.replace('someLocation')   //+ this will completely replace the history. and back button wont work

location.host //+ gives the address
location.origin //+ gives full location
location.pathname  //+ gives the path

history.back()   //+ it will go back to the page
history.forward()
history.length
history.go(5)   //+ go back 5 steps backward

navigator  //+ this contains browser info and some machine details
navigator.userAgent //+cthis is supposed to give the browwser name, but it is fake
navigator.clipboard   //+ can access clipboard.

navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((data) =>  {console.log(data)})   //+ for getting location.

//! Date
const date = new Date();   //+ this will give current date
date.getTime()  //+ gives time
date.getDate()

const anotherDate = new Date('07/11/2020');

throw new Error('something went wrong');  //+ creating error message. gives information of line

//! Events
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
const button = document.getElementById("buttonID");
function buttonClickHandler(){}
button.onclick(buttonClickHandler);
//+ we can do like this, using this, we can only add one event functions. if we do 2 time, it actually overrides the old one. mot recommended

button.addEventListener('click', buttonClickHandler);

button.removeEventListener('click', buttonClickHandler);
//+ here the same function should be passed. srrow functions might not work. we need to put the function in a constant and use it
//+ if we use bind, we might need to put it in another function


button.addEventListener('click', buttonEvent);
const buttonEvent = function buttonHandler(event){   //+ here event will contains the details of the event
  console.log(event);
  event.target;   //+ this contains the element which caused the event
  event.target.disabled = true;    //+ button have disabled property we can set to true
}

//! Other events
button.addEventListener('mouseenter', buttonClickHandler);  //+ if mouse enters the element. have relatedTarget property in event, which shows which
//+ was the previous element was before moving the mouse. if we move fast, then the value will be html

window.addEventListener('scroll', buttonClickHandler); //+ we can add to scrolling as well

formElement.addEventListener('submit', (event)=>{
  event.preventDefault();   //+ this will prevent the default behaviour of the browser. for example, for form tag and submit, when we submit, by default
  //+ the browser will reload. this method is available in every event
})

//% events have bubbling and capturing
//+ when we do a event, first it will go through capturing phase. then it will go through bubbling phase. capturing will gro from outside to inside
//+ of the element section . bubbling do the opposite. by default events are bubbling. inner element event happens first and then outer event.
button.addEventListener('click', buttonEvent, true);    //+ this will change the default behaviour.

//! event delegation
//+ when we have a ul and multiple li. we dont need to add event listener to every li. instead we can add it to the ul(parent). so
//+ it will work automatically for all inner element.
list.addEventListener('click', event => {
  event.target.classList.toggle('highlight')  //+ here one single even handle all of them. it will be defficult for complex structure
})

//+ but we can use element traversing to do it.

button.click();   //+ for clicking the button manually
//+ if we use this inside an event, it will give the element which is registered with the event

//! Drag and drop
//+ mark the element as draggable --> listen to dragstart event --> Accept drop over dragenter and dragover events - prevent default
//+ --> listen to dragleave event(optional)  -->  listen to drop event and update data / UI -->  listen to dragend event and update UI/Data(optional)

<h2 draggable="true">Draggable content</h2>
draggableElement.addEventListener('dragstart', event => {

  event.dataTransfer.setData('text/plain', this.id) //+ we can have different type
  event.dataTransfer.effectAllowed = 'move';  //+ effect
})

receivingElement.addEventListener('dragenter', event => {

//! Pure functions
//+ pure functions will produce same output for same input. and does not change anythingout of the function.

console. Log(calculateVatAmount(100));
console. log(calculateVatAmount (200));

//! closure functions
//+ every function in javascript is a closure
//+ outer variables can be used in inner functions. but inner cant use outside
//+ above example, tax will be memorized even when parent function finished executing. it will not delete the value from memory.
//+ but we can still use it if we call the inner function. this is same for global variables. functions will remember those values.

//! Recursive functions
function powerOf(x, n){
  let power = 1;

}

function powerOf(x, n){
if(n==1){

}
  return X * powerOf(x, n-1);  //+ this is recursion, calling same function inside. we can save code length
}

//! Advanced recursion.. go back tho this topic

//! Number
//+ every number is floating point. numbers are stored as 64 bit floating points
Number.MAX_VALUE;  //+ to check the max
Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER

(0.2 + 0.4).toFixed(2);   //+ we can use this to cut the points

//! BIGINT
let bigNumber = 68426843264872642764n;  //+ we can add n at the end
//+ we can do calculations. bu we cant mix the type.
BigInt(10);   //+ this will convert int to bigint

//= javascript have infinity
Number.isFinite(infinity);  //+ false
Math.pow();
Math.cos();   //+ there are lot of other functions

//! Random
Math.random(); //+ this will generate a random number between 0 and 1
Math.floor(num);  //+ this will remove the decimal points

//! Regular expressions
//+ it will check for pattern
const regex = new RegExp('');  //+ we can check like this
const regex= /^\S+@\S+\.\S+S/;   //+ the expression will be between //. this is for email
regex.test(stringToBeTested)

const regex2 = /(h|H)ello/   //+ here if hello or Hello is there in anywhere of the string input,regex will be true
//! go back if necessary.

//! Javascript is single threaded.
//+ javascript can only execute one task at a time. every step works in sequance. not simultaniously

//+ if there is a time cunsuming operation, it will block other operations to finish.
//+ if we make the operation asynchronous. then the task will taken care by different thread and other code will execute simultaneously
//+ after the task exexution is done, we use a callback to communicate with the other code

//+ addEventHandler works the same way. when we initialize the even handler. it will not block the other code execution by
//+ keep on checking the click event happened or not. it will work in the background and we are passing a call back function to it

//+ the asynch functions, for example timer callback function, which will be registered in a memory called Message que.
//+ after call Stack is cleared with other functions. this call back functions will move to the stack from message que.
//+ there is an event loop keep on running, which will check when stack is empty, and it will select the items from message que
//+ and move it to stack.

navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(successFunction, errorFunction); //+ for example, this function expects a callback. which will be called when its succesfull and failed
console.log('getting geo location')   //+ this will execute immediately without waiting.

//! Promises
//+ if we have multiple callback functions, we can use .then() which makes the code more readable. but the function should support it.
//+ instead of passing callbacks, we can call then(). but older function doesnt have it
//+ we can construct a promise variable and it will be set when we call the .then()

function setTimer(duration){
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {  //+execute when we call then()
